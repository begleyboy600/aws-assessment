"""
A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
A square NxN matrix M[][] is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. Here M[i][i] will always be 0.
Return the index of the celebrity, if there is no celebrity return -1.
Note: Follow 0 based indexing.
Follow Up: Can you optimize it to O(N)
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
M[][] = {{0 1 0},
         {0 0 0}, 
         {0 1 0}}
Output: 1
Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both
know 1. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity. 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
M[][] = {{0 1},
         {1 0}}
Output: -1
Given an array arr[ ] of n elements, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array. Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right which is greater than the current element.
If there does not exist next greater of current element, then next greater element for current element is -1. For example, next greater of the last element is always -1.

Examples

Input: arr[] = [1 3 2 4], n = 4
Output: 3 4 4 -1
Explanation: The next larger element to 1 is 3, 3 is 4, 2 is 4 and for 4, since it doesn't exist, it is -1.
Input: arr[] [6 8 0 1 3], n = 5
Output: 8 -1 1 3 -1
Explanation: The next larger element to 6 is 8, for 8 there is no larger elements hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1 , for 1 it is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger element on right and hence -1.
Input: arr[] [10, 20, 30, 50], n = 4
Output: 20 30 50 -1
Explanation: For a sorted array, the next element is next greater element also exxept for the last element.
Input: arr[] [50, 40, 30, 10], n = 4
Output: -1 -1 -1 -1
Explanation: For a reverse sorted array, the next greater element is always 1.
Expected Time Complexity : O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1018
